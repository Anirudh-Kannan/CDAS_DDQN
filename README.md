# Deep Q Learning based Recommender Systems

### Abstract
Today, recommendation systems are more prevalent than ever. While collaborative filtering was once an efficient approach, it is no longer robust given the volume of data and interactions that are required to be modeled today. Recent works have achieved significant success by using Reinforcement Learning agents in the context of recommender systems. Existing literature has shown the effectiveness of using Deep Q Networks to aid the Reinforcement Learning agent's decision making. To this end, we explore two formulations of Deep Q Networks in a Reinforcement Learning setting namely CDAS-DDQN and Naive-DDQN to provide recommendations. Experimental results evaluated on the MovieLens dataset highlight the viability of our approaches.
